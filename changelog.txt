## v1.7.3-Beta (not released)

*   **Security:** Improved password checking security (timing resistance).
*   **Security:** Reduced potential security risks by ensuring the web service user is only added to the dedicated `zfdash` group, not general admin groups like `sudo` or `wheel`.

*   **Fix:** Resolved an issue where snapshots wouldn't refresh correctly in the UI.

## v1.7.0-Beta (not released)
