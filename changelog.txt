# ZfDash Changelog

## v1.7.5-Beta initial release

*   **Web UI:** Improved visual appearance of the Web UI.
*   **Web UI:** Added a dedicated, styled login page (`login.html`).

## v1.7.3-Beta (not released)

*   **Security:** Improved password checking security (timing resistance).
*   **Security:** Reduced potential security risks by ensuring the web service user is only added to the dedicated `zfdash` group, not general admin groups like `sudo` or `wheel`.

## v1.7.2-Beta (not released)

*   **GUI:** The GUI now waits properly for the background daemon to start before proceeding.
*   **Fix:** Resolved an issue where snapshots wouldn't refresh correctly in the UI.
*   **Fix:** Fixed `zpool scrub` start/stop functionality.
*   **Install:** Added a script (`install_web_service.sh`) to install the Web UI as a systemd service for persistent running.
*   **Install:** Updated the main installation script (`install.sh`).

## v1.7.1-Beta (not released)

*   **Security:** Implemented strong password hashing (PBKDF2 with unique salt per user).
*   **Web UI:** Password changes are now handled securely by the background root daemon. The credentials file (`credentials.json`) is owned by root.
*   **Web UI:** If the credentials file is missing at startup, the daemon creates one with default credentials (`admin`/`admin`) - **CHANGE THESE IMMEDIATELY!**

## v1.7.0-Beta (not released)

*   **Security:** Reworked communication between the UI (GUI/Web) and the background daemon. Now uses secure kernel-level pipes instead of a user-owned socket file, preventing other user processes from potentially interacting with the daemon.

## v1.5.6-Beta (not released)

*   **Web UI:** Implemented user login functionality. Usernames and hashed passwords are stored in `credentials.json` (location varies depending on installation method).

## v1.5.5-Beta (not released)
