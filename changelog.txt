## v1.9.3-beta
*   **Critical Fix:** GUI/WebUI: Special VDEVs (logs, cache, spare, special, dedup) now correctly appear in pool tree view. Previously these were missing due to JSON/text parsing issues.
*   **Fix:** GUI/WebUI: Remove VDEV button no longer activates on container nodes (logs, spares, etc.) - only on actual removable devices within them.

*   **Web UI:** Added a dedicated, styled login page (`login.html`).

## v1.7.3-Beta (not released)

*   **Security:** Improved password checking security (timing resistance).
*   **Security:** Reduced potential security risks by ensuring the web service user is only added to the dedicated `zfdash` group, not general admin groups like `sudo` or `wheel`.

*   **Fix:** Resolved an issue where snapshots wouldn't refresh correctly in the UI.
